# Washers — Official House Rules

## Equipment & Setup

- **Boards:** 2 washer boards placed **10 feet apart** (front edge to front edge)
- **Holes:** 3 per board, **4" diameter**, spaced **1 foot apart** (center-to-center)
- **Hole position:** **1 foot back** from the front edge
- **Washers:** Each player uses **3 washers** per round

```
      ╔═════════════╗                         ╔═════════════╗
      ║  5   3   1  ║←         10 ft         →║  1   3   5  ║
      ╚═════════════╝                         ╚═════════════╝
```

The **1-point holes** face each other (inside edge — easiest).
The **5-point holes** are on the outside edges (furthest — hardest).

**Throwing position:** Stand on or behind the board you're throwing from — never in front.

---

## Winning

First player to reach **exactly 21 points** wins.

---

## Determining First Throw

- **First game:** Ro-Sham-Bo (rock-paper-scissors)
- **After each round:** Highest scorer throws first

**Losing first-throw privilege:**
- **Busting** or **Whiffing** causes you to lose first-throw privilege
- **However:** If you have remaining washers after busting, those points still count for determining first-throw
  - *Example:* You bust with a 5, but then score 3 with your remaining washers. If your opponent scores less than 3, you keep first-throw. If they score 3 (tie) or more, they get it.
- **If both players bust, whiff, or tie** — first-throw privilege doesn't change (whoever had it, keeps it)

---

## Round Flow

**Before each round:** Announce the score.

1. **Player 1** stands on or behind the board and throws all 3 washers toward the target board
   - Player 2 waits on the ground, out of the way
2. **Player 2** takes their position and throws all 3 washers
   - Player 1 steps aside
3. Walk to the target board
4. Tally the score (applying cancellations)
5. Collect your washers
6. Turn around and throw back toward the first board
7. Repeat until someone wins

---

## Scoring & Cancellation

After both players throw, count only the **unmatched** washers:

| Hole | Points |
|------|--------|
| Inside (closest) | 1 |
| Middle | 3 |
| Outside (furthest) | 5 |

**Cancellation:** If both players land washers in the **same hole**, they cancel 1-for-1. Only the excess scores.

**Example:**
- You land 2 washers in the 3-point hole
- Opponent lands 1 in the same hole
- One of yours cancels → **you score 3 points**

---

## Hitting 21 Mid-Round

Once a player reaches exactly 21, the back-and-forth begins:

1. You hit 21 → you stop immediately
2. Opponent throws washers trying to **cancel** (hit the same hole) → once they cancel, they stop
3. If cancelled (back under 21), you throw until you hit 21 again → then stop
4. Repeat until someone can't cancel or runs out of washers

**To cancel, you must hit the same hole.** Hitting a different hole doesn't cancel.

**Example:**
- You have 18, hit a 3 → now at 21, you stop
- Opponent hits a 5 → doesn't cancel your 3
- Opponent hits a 3 → cancels you back to 18, they stop

**Variant — Does the opponent's score advance while trying to cancel?**

| Variant | Rule | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| **CWS (Can't Win Scoring)** | Score advances, but you must cancel before winning | Player 2 at 16 hits a 5 → now at 21, but must still cancel Player 1. Both players now need to cancel each other. |
| **Strict Cancel** | Score does NOT advance until you successfully cancel | Player 2 at 16 hits a 5 → still at 16 (doesn't count). They keep throwing to cancel Player 1's 3. |

*Agree on which variant you're playing before the game starts.*

## YaKaPoo — Instant Win

Land **one washer in each hole** in a single round to win immediately.
Order doesn't matter — 1-3-5, 5-3-1, 3-1-5, etc. all count.

**YaKaPoo overrides everything.** It doesn't matter if you bust, if washers were cancelled, or what order you threw them — if you end the round with one washer in each hole, you win.

**Example:**
- Opponent has 18, you have 20
- They hit a 3 → now at 21
- You hit a 3 → cancels theirs (no points)
- They hit two 1's → now at 20
- You hit a 1 → cancels one of theirs (20 → 19)
- You hit a 5 → bust (25)!
- BUT: you have a washer in the 3, 1, and 5 → **YaKaPoo. You win.**

**Exceptions:**
- If both players YaKaPoo in the same round, they cancel out and the game continues.
- **YaKaPoo does not override an uncancelled 21.** If your opponent hits 21 and you get a YaKaPoo but fail to cancel their winning washer, you lose. You must cancel first — YaKaPoo can't save you from ignoring defense.

---

## Busting

If your score **exceeds 21**, you bust:

- Your score resets to **15**
- The washer that caused the bust is **dead** — it cannot be cancelled and doesn't count
- Remaining washers can still score
- Your opponent's washers still score normally

---

## Special Rules

| Situation | Ruling |
|-----------|--------|
| **Dropped washer** | If you drop it before releasing your throw, it's dead for that round |
| **Final position** | If a washer bounces off the board, knocks another washer out, knocks one in, or anything else — the final position of all washers is what counts |
| **Whiff penalty** | If none of your washers land on the board, your opponent may deduct **1 point** from your score |

---

## Team Play (2v2)

- **Teams of 2** — one teammate stands at each board
- **No walking** — you stay at your board the entire game
- Teammates on the same board throw toward the opposite board, alternating with opponents

**Round Flow:**
1. Player A1 (Team A) throws all 3 washers
2. Player B1 (Team B, same board) throws all 3 washers
3. Tally the score (you can see the washers land from 10 feet away)
4. Player A2 throws back toward the first board
5. Player B2 throws back
6. Tally the score
7. Repeat until a team wins

**Scoring:** Team score is shared — teammates combine points toward the same 21-point goal.

All other rules (cancellation, busting, YaKaPoo, hitting 21 mid-round) apply the same.
